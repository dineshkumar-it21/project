    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Augmented reality shopping allows customers to virtually try on and test products through an electronic device such as a smartphone or virtual reality headset</p>
    <h2>What is the objective of AR shopping?</h2>
    <p>AR allows ecommerce customers to preview products or experience services in their own environment and on their own time, before electing to make a purchase. Using AR, your customers can preview products and be more likely to pick the right product the first time.</p>
